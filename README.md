# Sales Prediction Using Linear Regression â€“ Machine Learning Project

This project implements a linear regression model to predict **product sales** based on advertising spending across **TV, Radio, and Newspaper** channels.

It is designed as an educational project for my AI master's portfolio, demonstrating the full machine learning pipeline using a small, custom dataset.

## ðŸ§  What it does:
- Uses historical ad spending data to predict expected sales.
- Trains a simple linear regression model with `scikit-learn`.
- Evaluates performance using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.
- Visualizes real vs predicted sales in a scatter plot.

## ðŸ’» Technologies:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## ðŸš€ How to run:

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
